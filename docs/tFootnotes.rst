A footnote is additional information about a certain part of the text. The footnote usually appears at the bottom of a book’s page.
In BTT Writer, a footnote is shown as a black page icon that you tap to display the footnote.
Footnotes can provide further explanation when:

* There are names or other words that differ between various Bible versions

* Some versions of the Bible have words or verses that are not in the ULB.

To translate a footnote:

1.	In the source text, tap the footnote to open it. 
     
    *	It’s not possible to copy/paste the footnote text.

    *	You may need to write down the translation because you can’t have the original footnote open and type into the footnote translation at the same time.

2.	Open the translated chunk in the Check view.

    * If the chunk is marked as done, tap the "mark the chunk as done" toggle so that the chunk is not marked as done.
    
    * Tap the pencil icon.
       
3.	Tap at the place where you want to add the footnote.
 
4.	Tap the Add Footnote icon at the top left of the translated chunk (this icon appears only in the Check view of the chunk).
 
5.	Translate the footnote in the source text into the “Add Footnote” pop-up and tap OK.
 
6.	The footnote icon now appears inline. Tap the check mark to save the changes.
 
To edit or delete a translated footnote:

1.	Ensure the chunk is **not** marked done and that you are **not** in Edit mode.

2.	Tap the footnote.
 
3.	Tap DELETE to delete it or EDIT to edit it.
 
4.	When finished, mark chunk as done.
