Using the Translation Resources
======================================

To help translators make the best translation possible, resources have been created. Once you have consulted the resources, then you are ready to make the best translation. Please use these resources when checking your translation!

The Resources include:

Words
-------

The Words are important terms found in the Bible. It is crucial that they be translated correctly. Each Word has a small article written about it as well as cross-references to other places that term is used in the Bible to ensure that it has been translated correctly there, too. See https://read.bibletranslationtools.org/u/WycliffeAssociates/en_tw/db1304c1a7/

Questions
----------

The Questions are comprehension questions that can be used to check the translation. These questions can be asked of anyone checking the translation work. Can the Target Language translation be used to correctly answer each of the questions? Read the question, answer the question from the information in the translated text, look at the answer in the program. Do both of the answers match? If so, then the translation is clear and accurate.

For Bible questions, see https://read.bibletranslationtools.org/u/WycliffeAssociates/en_tq/615fc363a5/

Notes
------

The Notes are cultural, linguistic, and exegetical notes that help to describe and explain the context in which the stories from Open Bible Stories and the Bible were written. They also inform the translator of options available to them. See Using the Notes for more information.

For Bible notes, see https://bibleineverylanguage.org/translations/ and select the Bible book under ULB Translation Notes.
